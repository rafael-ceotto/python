This a repository of some of my python work.

At the time, they used to be developed on jupyter notebook, using the anaconda application/browser to access it.

The first project is a RPG choice game, based on the film "Bandersnatch", where you could choose what path to follow by just typing or interacting with the screen
In that case, the Python libraries used were Colorea, Time, Pandas, Numpy and Beautiful Soup. 
It was a project to register the input of the user and return the output to the same according to the word type.

The second one is a prediction of a soccer championship that would try to know who was going to be the champion of the year.
For that case, Numpy, Pandas, Os, Beautiful Soup, SciPy Stats and requests were used to demonstrate the tables, as well.
From SciPy Stats I imported the distribution/coefient of Poisson. a statistical coeficient that is used to generate predictions based on previous happenings and probabilities.

Here's the link to the tables that were used and the poisson distribution explanation.

Unfortunaly, due to a loss of software and hardware, I'm only able to provide PDF's and notebooks with the code but feel free to access those and use it as needed.
